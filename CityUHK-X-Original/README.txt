This crowd dataset “CityUHK-X” contains 55 scenes (3,191 images in total), covering a camera tilt angle range of [-10, -65] degrees and a height range of [2.2, 16.0] meters. The training set consists of 43 scenes (2,503 images; 78,592 people), and the test set comprises 12 scenes (688 images; 28,191 people). The extrinsic parameters are known, and can be used as side information for learning models. More details can be found in the paper and accompanying supplemental.
